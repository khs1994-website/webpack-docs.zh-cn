Speed up development by <b>automatically installing & saving dependencies</b> with Webpack.

It is inefficient to <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> your
build script & server just to install
a dependency you didn't know you needed until now.

Instead, use `require` or `import` how you normally would and `npm install`
will happen **automatically to install & save missing dependencies** while you work!

## Install {#install}

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev npm-install-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage {#usage}

In your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
plugins: [
  new NpmInstallPlugin()
],
```

**This is equivalent to**:

```js
plugins: [
  new NpmInstallPlugin({
    // Use --save or --save-dev
    dev: false,
    // Install missing peerDependencies
    peerDependencies: true,
    // Reduce amount of console logging
    quiet: false,
    // npm command used inside company, yarn is not supported yet
    npm: 'npm'
  });
],
```

You can provide a `Function` to the `dev` to make it dynamic:

```js
plugins: [
  new NpmInstallPlugin({
    dev: function(module, path) {
      return [
        "babel-preset-react-hmre",
        "webpack-dev-middleware",
        "webpack-hot-middleware",
      ].indexOf(module) !== -1;
    },
  }),
],
```
